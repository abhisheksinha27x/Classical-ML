## ✅ 1. **“Revert to a clean training set”**

> “Revert to a clean training set (by copying `strat_train_set` once again)”

### 📌 What It Means:

After doing some early exploration, visualizations, or transformations on your training data (like adding new features, creating income categories, etc.), your dataset might now contain:

* Temporary columns (like `income_category`)
* Altered values
* Visualization-specific formats

So before you begin **actual data preparation for modeling**, you want to start fresh — from a **clean, untouched copy** of your training data.

### ✅ Why?

To avoid carrying over:

* Dirty or temporary columns (e.g. `income_category`)
* Inconsistent or irreversible changes
* Errors from exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### 🧠 Example:

```python
housing = strat_train_set.copy()  # <- Clean copy
```

---

## ✅ 2. **“Separate the predictors and the labels”**

> “We should also separate the predictors and the labels, since we don’t necessarily want to apply the same transformations to both.”

### 📌 What It Means:

In supervised learning, your dataset consists of:

* **Features (predictors)**: inputs used to predict something
* **Labels (target values)**: what you want to predict

So you **separate them** into:

```python
housing = strat_train_set.drop("median_house_value", axis=1)  # Features only 
housing_labels = strat_train_set["median_house_value"].copy()  # Target variable
```

### ✅ Why?

1. **Cleaner workflow**: Helps organize your pipeline — most preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding) applies to **predictors only**, not labels.
2. **Prevents data leakage**: If you transform labels accidentally (e.g., normalize them), your model will learn wrong relationships.
3. **Scikit-Learn requirements**: Training methods like `model.fit(X, y)` expect separate inputs and labels.

## 🧠 What Are **Predictors** and **Labels**?

### 🔹 **Predictors** (also called **features** or **inputs**):

These are the **input variables** you give to a machine learning model — the known information you use to make predictions.

> Think of predictors as **the cause**.

Examples in a housing dataset:

* `median_income`
* `housing_median_age`
* `total_rooms`
* `longitude`, `latitude`

---

### 🔸 **Labels** (also called **targets** or **outputs**):

This is the **value the model is trying to predict** — the output.

> Think of the label as **the effect**.

Example in the housing dataset:

* `median_house_value` ← This is what you want to predict.

## 🎯 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're a real estate investor trying to predict house prices:

| Predictor (Feature)   | Label (Target) |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Location              | House price 💰 |
| Size in sq ft         |                |
| Number of rooms       |                |
| Median income in area |                |

You're saying:

> *“Based on these predictors, what do I think the house price (label) will be?”*

---

## 🛠️ In Code (Python/Pandas):

```python
# Separate predictors and labels
X = housing.drop("median_house_value", axis=1)  # predictors
y = housing["median_house_value"]               # label
```
