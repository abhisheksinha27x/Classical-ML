## What is a Performance Measure?

A **performance measure** (or evaluation metric) is a **quantitative way to assess how well your machine learning model is doing** on a given task. It tells you **how good or bad your model’s predictions are** compared to the actual outcomes.

## Why do we need Performance Measures?

* **Objective assessment:** Instead of guessing if a model is good, performance measures give you numbers to compare models.
* **Model selection:** To pick the best model or tuning parameters by comparing scores.
* **Monitor progress:** To track improvement as you iterate on model design or data quality.
* **Align with goals:** Different tasks have different goals — a measure tells you how well your model meets those goals.
* **Avoid overfitting:** By measuring on unseen data, you check if your model generalizes well beyond training data.

## Common Performance Measures by Task

### 1. **Classification Tasks**

Predict discrete categories (e.g., spam or not spam)

* **Accuracy:** % of correctly predicted labels (good for balanced classes)
* **Precision:** Of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?
  (Good when false positives are costly)
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** Of all actual positives, how many did you detect?
  (Good when missing positives is costly)
* **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balances both
* **ROC-AUC:** Measures model’s ability to rank positives higher than negatives

### 2. **Regression Tasks**

Predict continuous values (e.g., house price)

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average squared difference between prediction & truth (penalizes large errors)
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE, in original units
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference (less sensitive to outliers)
* **R-squared:** % variance explained by the model (higher is better)

### 3. **Ranking / Information Retrieval**

(e.g., search engine results)

* **Precision\@K, Recall\@K**
* **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**
* **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**

## How to Choose the Right Performance Measure?

1. **Understand your business or problem goal**
   What are the costs of different errors?

   * For **medical diagnosis**: missing a disease (false negative) is worse → prioritize **Recall**
   * For **spam filters**: wrongly marking a legit email as spam (false positive) is worse → prioritize **Precision**

2. **Look at data balance**

   * If classes are highly imbalanced (e.g., fraud detection), **accuracy** is misleading → use **Precision, Recall, or F1**

3. **Interpretability**

   * Choose metrics that stakeholders understand and care about.

4. **Model type and output**

   * For regression → error metrics (MSE, MAE, R²)
   * For classification → classification metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC)

5. **Compare models on the same metric**
   Always compare apples to apples — same metric, same data split.

## Summary Table

| Task Type      | Popular Metrics                          | When to Use                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classification | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC | Balanced data → Accuracy; Imbalanced → Precision/Recall/F1               |
| Regression     | MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²                       | MSE/RMSE for large errors; MAE for robustness; R² for variance explained |
| Ranking        | Precision\@K, MAP, NDCG                  | When order of results matters                                            |

## 🔁 Model Selection & Tuning

Performance measures are also used to:

* Compare different models (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).
* Tune hyperparameters during cross-validation (e.g., optimize for F1-score instead of accuracy).
