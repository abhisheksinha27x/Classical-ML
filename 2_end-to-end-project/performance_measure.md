### 🔍 What Does It Mean to **Select a Performance Measure** in Machine Learning?

**Selecting a performance measure** means **choosing the right metric** to evaluate how well your machine learning model is performing on a given task. The **performance measure** gives you a **quantitative score** that tells you:

* How accurate or useful the model is.
* Whether it is improving or overfitting.
* What trade-offs it’s making (e.g., precision vs. recall).

## ✅ Why Is This Important?

Different ML tasks require **different performance measures** because each task has different goals and risks.

## ⚙️ Common Types of Performance Measures

| Task Type          | Performance Measures                           | Example                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Regression**     | RMSE, MAE, R²                                  | Predicting house prices           |
| **Classification** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC | Spam detection, disease diagnosis |
| **Clustering**     | Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin Index         | Customer segmentation             |
| **Ranking**        | Mean Reciprocal Rank, NDCG                     | Search engines                    |
| **Probabilistic**  | Log Loss (cross-entropy), Brier score          | Weather forecasting               |

## 📊 Example – Choosing for a Regression Task

If you're predicting house prices:

* You might choose **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to **penalize large errors more heavily**.
* Or use **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** for a **more robust**, less sensitive score.

---

## 🔁 Model Selection & Tuning

Performance measures are also used to:

* Compare different models (e.g., Linear Regression vs. Random Forest).
* Tune hyperparameters during cross-validation (e.g., optimize for F1-score instead of accuracy).
