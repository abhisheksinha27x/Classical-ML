## üîç 1.5 Testing and Validating Models

* Use a **test set** to evaluate generalization performance.
* Use **cross-validation** to better assess model performance on unseen data.
* Performance metrics depend on task (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.)

## üß† Summary of Chapter 1

1. **ML is about learning patterns from data** instead of writing explicit rules.
2. There are different types of ML (supervised, unsupervised, RL, etc.).
3. Choosing the right algorithm depends on **task, data, and constraints**.
4. Key challenges include **data quality**, **overfitting/underfitting**, and **feature engineering**.
5. Understanding the **landscape** helps you choose the right tools and models.
