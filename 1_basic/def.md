## üåü 1.1 What is Machine Learning?

### Definition:

Machine Learning is a **subset of artificial intelligence** that enables systems to learn from **data** and make **predictions or decisions** without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

> **Arthur Samuel‚Äôs definition** (1959):
> ‚ÄúField of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.‚Äù

> **Tom Mitchell‚Äôs definition** (1997):
> ‚ÄúA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.‚Äù

### Core Idea:

Instead of writing rules by hand, **ML systems learn the rules (patterns)** from data.

## üöÄ 1.2 Why Use Machine Learning?

When:

* You have **complex problems** with **no clear rules** (e.g., facial recognition, natural language).
* Rules are **too hard to manually code** (e.g., detecting spam, voice commands).
* You want the model to **adapt and improve** over time (e.g., recommendation systems, self-driving).

ML excels in:

* Fraud detection
* Predictive maintenance
* Customer segmentation
* Language translation
* Image classification
* Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)
