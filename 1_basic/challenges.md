## 🏗️ 1.4 Main Challenges in ML

### 1.4.1 **Bad Data**

* Insufficient quantity of training data
* Non-representative data
* Poor-quality data (noisy, errors)
* Irrelevant features

### 1.4.2 **Overfitting vs Underfitting**

* **Overfitting**: Model fits training data too well (high variance)
* **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to learn the data (high bias)

### 1.4.3 **Feature Engineering**

* Feature selection
* Feature extraction
* Creating new features (domain knowledge)
