## 🎯 Goal: What Are We Trying to Do?

In machine learning, we often have a **model** (like a line or a neural network) that tries to predict something — and we want to **make that model as accurate as possible**.

To do that, we define a **loss function** (or **cost function**) that measures **how wrong** the model is.

> **Our job:** Minimize this loss by adjusting the model's parameters (like weights).

This is where **Gradient Descent** comes in.

## 🧮 What Is Gradient Descent?

**Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm used to **minimize the loss function**.

### 🔁 Basic idea:

1. Start with **random model parameters**.
2. Calculate how **bad** the model is (loss).
3. Adjust parameters in the **direction that reduces** the loss — using the **gradient**.
4. Repeat until the model improves.

### 💡 The "gradient" is just:

> The direction of **steepest increase** — so we move in the **opposite** direction to go downhill (i.e., to reduce error).

## ⛓️ Types of Gradient Descent

| Type                                  | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch Gradient Descent**            | Uses the **whole dataset** to compute the gradient in each step |
| **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** | Uses **1 sample at a time** (faster, noisier updates)           |
| **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**       | Uses **small batches** (e.g. 32, 64 samples) per update         |

## ⚡ So What Is **Stochastic Gradient Descent**?

“**Stochastic**” = Random.
Instead of using the **entire dataset** to update the model, **SGD randomly picks one sample** at a time.

---

## 🔄 How SGD Works:

```text
Repeat until convergence:
    Pick a single random training sample (xᵢ, yᵢ)
    Compute gradient of loss for that sample
    Update model parameters in opposite direction of gradient
```

### Update Rule:

```python
θ = θ - η * ∇J(θ, xᵢ, yᵢ)
```

Where:

* `θ` = model parameters (e.g. weights)
* `η` = learning rate (step size)
* `∇J` = gradient of the loss function w\.r.t θ

---

## 🧠 Pros of SGD

✅ Fast for large datasets
✅ Good for **online learning** (new data keeps coming)
✅ Can escape **local minima** due to randomness

---

## ⚠️ Cons of SGD

❌ Noisy updates → can "bounce" around the minimum
❌ Sensitive to learning rate
❌ Needs more tuning (e.g., learning rate schedule)

---

## 📈 Visual Intuition

Imagine standing on a **mountain** (high loss), and you want to get to the **valley** (low loss).

* **Batch GD**: You calculate the best downhill direction based on the entire landscape.
* **SGD**: You make small jumps based on **local guesses**. Sometimes you go a bit wrong, but eventually, you get there faster.

## 💻 Example in Python with Scikit-Learn

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

clf = SGDClassifier(loss="log_loss", learning_rate="optimal", random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Here, `SGDClassifier` uses SGD under the hood to learn a **linear classifier** like logistic regression or SVM.
